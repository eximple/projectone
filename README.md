# Projector 

This started out as a demo of github pages for a project, nothing more then that. Each project on GitHub can have its own project pages accesable as https://docunid.github.io/<projectname>.

The Projector Project Pages are served from `master/docs` and can be reached at https://docunid.github.io/projector/
