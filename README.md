# Projector 

This started out as a demo of github pages for a project, nothing more then that. Each project on GitHub can have its own project pages accesable as https://{user or organization).github.io/(projectname).

The Projector Project Pages are served from branch `gh-pages` and can be reached at https://eximple.github.io/projector/
